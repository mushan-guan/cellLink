Description: When processing Seurat objects, a group of cells can yield multiple dimensionality reduction results. 
    While these alternative results can be retained for specific analyses, it is not feasible to display multiple 
    clustering outcomes on a single plot, nor is it convenient to examine a cell's position across different 
    dimensionality reductions. CellLink package provides a straightforward visualization method, allowing specified 
    cells (which can be sampled based on information such as orig.ident or seurat_clusters in meta.data) to be 
    mapped between different dimensionality reduction results and connected with lines.
    It is essential to ensure that the cells used for plotting belong to the intersection of these dimensionality reduction results, 
    meaning the barcodes must be consistent.
